³ Introduction ³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

      ACiDDraw is a utility for manipulating ANSI and ASCII text. It is based
      upon Ian Davis's TheDraw (tm). Many of it's basic features, and their
      organization parallel TheDraw. In addition to these, however, it has
      many refined and added features. The authors of this utility have sought
      to include, within an efficient and tightly organized program, the most
      useful tools for manipulating ANSI and ASCII text that could be
      conceived. The ideas of some of the most experienced artists in these
      areas have been implemented in every way possible, to create, what we
      hope, is the most useful utility of this type to date.

                              or not ACiDDraw will use XMS memory.
                              With out XMS memory ACiDDraw will not have
                              multiple pages.

    Number of Pages        :  This will set the maximum number of XMS pages
                              which ACiDDraw will use.  (1 XMS page will
                              take up 160k of XMS memory)


    Blinking Cursor        :  This option, if on will make the cursor appear
                              to be flickering.  This is useful when editing
                              a screen which uses characters which hide the
                              cursor.


    Length of ANSI         :  This option will set the method at which ACiDDraw
                              determines which is the last line of the ANSI.
                              Possible options are entire page, the position
                              of the cursor (anything about will be saved), and
                              auto-detect.

    Filename Guessing      :  This new option will cause ACiDDraw to try and
                              determine what the file name should be called
                              when saving.  This is based upon the filename
                              which was loaded and the saving format of the
                              image.  This option will become evident when
                              you enter the filename to save an ANSI as.  The
                              filename can still be edited before saving.

    File Backup Format     :  This option will allow the user to select what
                              action should be taken when trying to save
                              a file with the same name as another.  Possible
                              options are overwrite, .BAK which will backup
                              the existing file with the extension .BAK, and
                              sequential.
                              The sequential save is a unique feature, this
                              option will automatically give the file an
                              extension of .001 - .999 depending on what files
                              already exist.  This option can be used to save
                              images in a progressive order.

    Start ANSI With        :  This option will determine whether ACiDDraw will
    Default Color             reset the color of a ANSI file to the default
                              grey on black.  This option, if on will place
                              a esc[0m before an ANSI file.

    End ANSI With Default  :  This option is like the one above, except it
    Color                     sets whether or not to reset to a default
                              grey on black after an ANSI file.

    Ascii Save Method      :  This option, either full or optimize will
                              set whether or not to try and place a carriage
                              return (if possible) for ASCII files which
                              do not take up the entire line (Optimize)

    Write Tab              :  This option will set whether or not to
    Configuration             save the tab configuration to disk after
                              tab positions are set.

    Swap File Path         :  This is the path in which to place a swap
                              file when ACiDDraw shells to DOS. (If no XMS
                              is available)

IMPORTANT - For this version, it is no longer required to re-enter the
            program after changing a page size, but any work in the pages
            will NOT be saved.

³ Saving An Image ³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

 ALT-S              : This is the key combination to save an ANSI.
 (Save ANSI)          The following save methods are available
                      ANSI :  Standard method for storing graphics in text
                              mode.  The length of the ANSI is automatically
                              detected on the first blank line.  The
                              characters per line option determine how many
                              characters there will be before a carriage
                              return.  An extension of .ANS is automatically
                              placed onto a file with no extension.
                     ASCII :  This method uses all the ASCII characters, but
                              without ANSI color and movement codes.  The
                              line length is also auto-detected.
                    BINARY :  This is a raw binary dump of the entire virtual
                              screen.  No length and width data is mentioned
                              in the file.  You must use sauce to determine
                              these.
                    PASCAL :  This format is used for the ability to
                              import images directly into pascal programs.
                              NOTE - Be careful when saving an image over
                                     400 lines.  This will cause the pascal
                                     array to be greater than 64k.
                         C :  This format is used to allow images to be
                              imported in to the C language.

                       ASM : This format is used with assembly programs.
                             It creates a regular text file which contain
                             all the necessary information to incorporate
                             your art work into an assembly program.

                   PCBOARD : This save format is used with the PCBOARD(Tm)
                             type bulletin board system.  The only codes
                             supported are color changing codes.  So far no
                             PCBOARD commands are supported.

                       COM : This is a self displaying file.  Images can
                             only have a width of 80 columns, and a
                             maximum length of 400 lines.  When the .COM
                             file is create, the use of the up and down
                             arrow keys, home, end, page up, and page down
                             can all be used to view the file.  Any image
                             saved in this format will be AUTOMATICALLY
                             make 80 columns and cut off at 400 lines.
